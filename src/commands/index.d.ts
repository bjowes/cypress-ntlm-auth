     * authentication is supported. In addition, wildcards are allowed to simplify specifying hosts for a whole
     * intranet. Ports cannot be combined with wildcards. Example: `['localhost:4200', '*.acme.com']`

     * @param {string} password the password or the account to authenticate with
     * @param {string} domain (optional) the domain for the account to authenticate with
     * (for AD account authentication). Default value: the domain of the ntlmHost.
     * @param {string} workstation (optional) the workstation name of the client. Default value: `os.hostname()`
     * @param {number} ntlmVersion (optional) the version of the NTLM protocol to use. Valid values are 1 and 2.
     * Default value: 2. This can be useful for legacy hosts that don't support NTLMv2 or for certain scenarios where
     * the NTLMv2 handshake fails (the plugin does not implement all features of NTLMv2 yet).

      ```js
      cy.ntlm(['ntlm.acme.com','api.acme.com'], 'TheUser', 'ThePassword', 'TheDomain');
